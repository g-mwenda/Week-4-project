WEEK 4 PROJECT: WEATHER APPLICATION; BY GABRIEL MWENDA.

As a user, I can type the name of any location on the search bar and the app will fetch the weather condition from an external weather API and display it.

The app displays the Temperature in Degrees Celsius, an icon showing the time of day and sky conditon, a short description of the sky condition,the humidity and windspeed in Kilometres per hour.

I have added a slight aesthetic touch to the app, such that the background image changes every time a user searches for a new location, the image is a theme associated with the location e.g The eiffel tower when one searches for weather in Paris.
